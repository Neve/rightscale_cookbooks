This\nincludes setting up the running of periodic recipes and setting up swap.\n\n## REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Requires a virtual machine launched from a RightScale managed RightImage.\n\n## COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:\n\nPlease see `metadata.rb` file for the latest dependencies.\n\n## KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\nThere are no known limitations.\n\n## SETUP/USAGE:\n\n* Place the `sys::default` recipe into the boot recipes to have your\n  server set up with any periodic recipes from the inputs.\n* Place the `sys::setup_swap` recipe into the boot recipes to set up\n  swap on your server. You may wish to use ephemeral storage for swap, in that\n  case you should include the `block_device::setup_ephemeral` recipe\n  before it.\n* You can disable and enable the periodic recipes by running the\n  `sys::do_reconverge_list_disable` and\n  `sys::do_reconverge_list_enable` recipes.\n\n## DETAILS:\n\n### System Consistency (re-convergence)\n\nTo enforce a consistent system state, one can use this LWRP to schedule\na cron job to periodically run a recipe. Optional interval in minutes can be\npassed (default 15 minutes) -- with a random starting offset based on fixed 10\nmin splay (to distribute runs being performed by multiple systems).\n\nTo start a periodic reconverge:\n\n    sys_reconverge \"mycookbook::myrecipe\"\n\nTo stop a periodic reconverge:\n\n    sys_reconverge \"mycookbook::myrecipe\" do\n      action :disable\n    end\n\n## LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.
