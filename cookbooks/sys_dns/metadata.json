This will install the support tools and chef providers for\nthe dynamic DNS provider selected by the \"DNS Service Provider\" input. When\nusing a RightScale ServerTemplate, this will automatically add the common DNS\nservice provider attributes to your ServerTemplate inputs. Place\n`sys_dns::do_set_private` recipe in your runlistto set the DNS record identified\nby the тАЬDNS Record IDтАЭ input to the first private IP address of the instance.\n\n## DETAILS:\n\n### General\n\nCookbook currently supports Cloud DNS, DNSMadeEasy, DynDNS, and Amazon Route53\nDNS service providers.\nA new chef provider can be created to add support for additional dynamic DNS\nservice providers.\n\nFor additional information: {Deployment Prerequisites}[http://support.rightscale.com/03-Tutorials/Deployment_Prerequisites_(Chef)]\n\n### Attributes:\n\nThese are settings used in recipes and templates. Default values are noted.\n\n* `node[sys_dns][choice]` -\n  The name of your DNS provider.\n* `node[sys_dns][id]` -\n  The unique identifier that is associated with the DNS A record of the server.\n* `node[sys_dns][user]` -\n  The username that is used to access and modify your DNS A records.\n* `node[sys_dns][password]` -\n  The password that is used to access and modify your DNS A records.\n* `node[sys_dns][region]` -\n  Region where the A records should be modified. This input only applies to\n  Cloud DNS.\n\n### Libraries-helpers:\n\nUse this section only if your cookbook contains any libraries.\nGive complete description of library purpose and functionality.\nProvide examples of how it is used in recipes.\n\n#### Example:\n\n**RightScale::DnsTools::CloudDNS.new(Chef::Log).action_set(id, user, password,\naddress, region)**\n**RightScale::DnsTools::DME.new(Chef::Log).action_set(id, user, password,\naddress)**\n**RightScale::DnsTools::DynDNS.new(Chef::Log).action_set(id, user, password,\naddress)**\n**RightScale::DnsTools::AWS.new(Chef::Log).action_set(id, user, password,\naddress)**\n\nReturn the result of A record update process.\n\nParameters:\n\n* `id::`\n  The unique identifier that is associated with the DNS A record of the server.\n* `user::`\n  The username that is used to access and modify the DNS A records.\n* `password::`\n  The password that is used to access and modify the DNS A records.\n* `address::`\n  Private IP address of the instance running the recipe.\n* `region::`\n  Region where the A records should be modified. This input only applies to\n  Cloud DNS.\n\nReturns:\n\n`Chef::Log::` A record successful update message.\n\nRaise:\n\n`Chef::Log::` Error message that may have occurred during the update process.\n\n### LWRPs:\n\nThe 'set' interface is defined by a Lightweight Resource, which can be found in\nthe resources/default.rb file.\n\nUsed to pass data to the helper file and call the corresponding DNS provider.\n\nFor more information, please see [Lightweight Resources and Providers][Guide].\n\n[Guide]: http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/08-Chef_Development/Lightweight_Resources_and_Providers_(LWRP)\n\n#### Example:\n\nCommon attributes\n\n* `:id` -\n  The unique identifier that is associated with the DNS A record of the server.\n* `:user` -\n  The username that is used to access and modify your DNS A records.\n* `:password` -\n  The password that is used to access and modify your DNS A records.\n* `:address` -\n  Private IP address of the instance running the recipe.\n* `:region` -\n  Region where the A records should be modified. This input only applies to\n  Cloud DNS.\n* `:choice` -\n  One of the supported DNS providers:\"DNSMadeEasy\"/\"DynDNS\"/\"Route53\"/\"CloudDNS\"\n\n#### Example:\n\n**Update Action**\n\nTo update A record with a server's private IP address:\n\n    sys_dns \"default\" do\n      id node[:db][:dns][:slave][:id]\n      address private_ip\n      action :set\n    end\n\n## LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.
